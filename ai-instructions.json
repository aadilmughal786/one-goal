    "Always include the full file path as a comment at the top of every file (e.g., // app/services/authService.ts).",
    "Use the '@/' path alias for imports from the './app' directory, as configured in tsconfig.json.",
    "Leverage the existing dependencies listed in package.json when adding new features.",
    "Utilize existing utility functions (like those in app/utils/) wherever it makes sense to avoid code duplication.",
    "The project is a Next.js static export build, configured for deployment on GitHub Pages. No API routes or server-side rendering is used.",
    "User authentication is handled exclusively through Google Sign-In via Firebase.",
    "Strictly avoid using the 'any' type in TypeScript. Use it only as a last resort if it provides a significant advantage and a specific type is not feasible.",
    "Implement loading indicators (e.g., spinners) on all action buttons (like save, delete, update) to provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations.",
    "Apply the 'cursor-pointer' Tailwind CSS utility class to all clickable UI elements to ensure a clear user experience.",
    "Avoid vague comments like 'adding this line here.' All comments should be meaningful and explain the 'why' behind the code, not just the 'what'."
