# Contributing to One Goal

First off, thank you for considering contributing to One Goal! We're excited to see the community get involved. This document provides a set of guidelines to ensure that contributing to the project is a smooth and effective process for everyone.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and improving documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching the [Issues](https://github.com/aadilmughal786/one-goal/issues) on GitHub.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/aadilmughal786/one-goal/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it first. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most One Goal users.

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to One Goal? You can start by looking through `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/aadilmughal786/one-goal/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/aadilmughal786/one-goal/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.
